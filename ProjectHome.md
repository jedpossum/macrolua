  * MacroLua can start playing from a savestate and can record player input to create new scripts.

**[AutoMacro](AutoMacroDocumentation.md)** is a tool for scripting player input for any game played on the PC, including emulators for newer systems.

**[TranScripter](TranScripterDocumentation.md)** is a converter that injects scripts directly into the input recording files, for emulators that don't have Lua.
